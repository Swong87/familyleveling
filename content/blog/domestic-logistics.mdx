## The Hidden Problem of Shared Space

When both partners work from home, something subtle happens.

You don’t fight about *work*.  
You fight about **logistics**.

Who gets interrupted?
Who handles sick days?
Who makes lunch?
Who hears the kid crying first?
Who’s allowed to “focus”?

Without realizing it, most WFH couples fall into:
- One **default parent**
- One **default worker**

And neither role is explicitly chosen.

It just… happens.

---

## Why WFH Creates More Resentment (Not Less)

Remote work removes physical boundaries.

Which sounds great.

Until every responsibility becomes **negotiated in real time**:

- “Can you grab them?”
- “I’m in a meeting.”
- “So am I.”
- “Well, mine is with my boss.”
- “Mine is with a client.”

This constant micro-negotiation is exhausting.

Not because anyone is lazy —  
but because the system is undefined.

## Introducing the Family SLA

In tech, an SLA (Service Level Agreement) defines:
- Responsibilities
- Response times
- Escalation rules
- Ownership

You need the same thing at home.

A **Family SLA** is a simple written agreement that answers:

> When something happens, who is *on point*?

Not emotionally.
Not situationally.
Contractually.

---

## The 4 Sections of a Family SLA

You can fit this on one page.

Seriously.

### 1. Default Roles

Who is responsible by default for:

- Morning routine
- School drop-off
- Meals
- Bedtime
- Sick kids
- House logistics

This doesn’t mean one person does everything.
It means **someone owns each domain**.

Ownership beats ambiguity.

---

### 2. Focus-Time Blocks

Define protected work time.

Example:

**Partner A**
- Deep work: 9–11am
- Meetings: flexible
- Emergency interrupts only

**Partner B**
- Deep work: 1–3pm
- On-call for kids: mornings

Now no one has to ask:
“Can I focus right now?”

It’s already agreed.

---

### 3. Handoff Rules

This is where most friction lives.

Define rules like:

- Meeting > async work
- External > internal
- One interruption per hour max
- Text before entering office

You’re not preventing interruptions.
You’re **standardizing them**.

Which removes emotional charge.

---

### 4. Escalation Protocol

What happens when both are busy?

Pre-decide:

- Which meetings are uninterruptible?
- When does TV become acceptable?
- When does a sitter get called?
- When does work get rescheduled?

If the rule exists *before* the crisis,
there is no argument during it.

---

## The Psychological Shift That Matters

This isn’t about chores.

It’s about **mental load**.

The default parent isn’t tired from tasks.
They’re tired from **constant cognitive ownership**.

The Family SLA does one powerful thing:

It makes labor **visible, named, and shared**.

Which turns resentment into systems.

---

## Recommended Tool: Shared Digital Family Planner

The fastest way to make a Family SLA real is to externalize it.

A shared planner lets you:
- See each other’s meetings
- Block focus time
- Schedule handoffs
- Track responsibilities

Without constant verbal negotiation.

## The 30-Minute Family SLA Workshop

Do this once. Save months of friction.

### Step 1 — Brain Dump (10 min)
Each partner writes:
- Everything they currently handle
- Everything they *feel* responsible for

Compare lists.
This is usually eye-opening.

---

### Step 2 — Assign Ownership (10 min)
For each category:
- One owner
- One backup
- One escalation rule

No shared ownership.
Shared ownership means no ownership.

---

### Step 3 — Schedule Focus (10 min)
Block:
- Deep work time
- On-call time
- Flex time

Put it in your calendars.

Now it’s real.

## The Real Win

The goal isn’t 50/50.

The goal is **predictability and fairness**.

WFH only works long-term if:
- Both partners can focus
- Both partners feel supported
- Neither partner feels like the default

The Family SLA doesn’t make your life perfect.

But it turns chaos into coordination.

And coordination is the real productivity hack for working parents.
